# PROUCT/SERVICE IDEA
Our idea at STUDYHUB is to provide online educational content tailored to our Nigerian educational system’s curriculum.
This content comprise of video, audio, and downloadable document files which are available for free or at a stipulated price.
This video, audio and document content is created by student content creators in any of the Nigerian universities, who are in different faculties and departments who must have gained a better understanding on a topic or course area and are willing to make videos and write summaries for other students who need it, either for free or a set out amount online.

# WHAT PROBLEM DOES STUDYHUB SOLVE?

Lack of student centered learning, and student peer to peer learning. We are creating a better learning and studying environment for students outside the classroom. Students come to learn from their peers, communicate with their peers within their university and other universities and institutions. 
We are creating an online student community to answer questions any student might have, and the answers are 100% localized and given from a fellow students view point.
We are reducing the percentage of students with poor academic performance, by providing structured and personalized courses, training and revision exercises that are always available on their smart phone, laptop or desktop computer.
We are making reading more flexible by providing all materials in softcopy and xml open source readable form making studying anywhere possible.
